This repository provides an **end-to-end PyTorch implementation of Stable Diffusion**, a cutting-edge generative model for creating realistic images from text prompts. Stable Diffusion is based on the principles of **latent diffusion**, where the diffusion process operates in a lower-dimensional latent space, making it computationally efficient while maintaining high image quality.

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate high-quality images from natural language prompts.
- **Efficient Latent Diffusion:** Diffusion is performed in a compressed latent space for faster training and inference.
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporates attention-based models for enhanced context understanding.
- **Pretrained Models:** Leverage pretrained weights to experiment and fine-tune Stable Diffusion.
- **Custom Training Support:** Train on your own datasets to create personalized diffusion models.
